// src/lib/breakers.js
//
// Breakers v1 data layer. For each probe class, a small catalogue of
// concrete adversarial inputs that demonstrate what a real attacker
// would type to exploit the finding. Static only — every entry is a
// rendered string. PreFlight does not send, execute, or otherwise act
// on these payloads. The display surface (BreakersPanel) is a textbox
// with a copy button plus a plain-English description of what the
// payload does.
//
// Why this exists: a finding that says "missing input validation" reads
// abstract. The same finding with a "this is what someone would type"
// example reads as concrete and actionable. The Breakers panel is the
// answer to "what does this actually look like."
//
// Safety contract (the bar for adding a new entry here):
//   1. The payload is a string. Not code, not a binary, not a script.
//   2. The "effect" describes what the payload achieves; the user has
//      to deliberately replay it against their own system to observe it.
//   3. No payload references a real production endpoint. Anonymized hosts
//      only (example.com, attacker.example, etc.).
//   4. No payload includes real credentials, real tokens, or real exploit
//      chains against named third parties.
//   5. Static analysis only — PreFlight never executes a Breaker.
//
// Schema per entry:
//   {
//     name: 'Short human label',
//     payload: 'The actual string',
//     where: 'The input shape this targets (form field, URL param, etc.)',
//     effect: 'What happens when the payload is processed by vulnerable code',
//     note: '(optional) caveat, mitigations defeated, etc.',
//   }
