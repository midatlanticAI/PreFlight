// Severity ordering, per-severity weight, and the score calculation.
//
// The model: every finding subtracts its severity weight from 100. Critical
// and high are uncapped (a real exploitable issue should tank the number).
// Medium / low / info have a capped TOTAL contribution: a repo whose only
// problems are cosmetic (SEO meta, a missing canonical) cannot be dragged
// into "critical" territory by sheer count. Two early users reported a
// frontend repo scoring 32 ("CRITICAL") off nothing but sparse meta tags;
// that was this: unbounded subtraction of dozens of low-severity findings.
//
// The tier LABEL is additionally severity-aware (see riskTier in theme.js):
// a repo with no critical and no high findings is never labelled CRITICAL or
// HIGH, regardless of count. Score answers "how much"; severity answers
// "how bad". The label must reflect the worst real finding, not the volume.

export const SEV_ORDER = ['critical', 'high', 'medium', 'low', 'info'];
export const SEV_WEIGHT = { critical: 25, high: 10, medium: 5, low: 2, info: 1 };

// Maximum TOTAL points each severity band may subtract. critical/high are
// intentionally uncapped. medium/low/info are bounded so noise can't sink
// the score: worst case from a cosmetic-only repo is -(30+12+5) = -47, i.e.
// it floors at 53 (MODERATE), never CRITICAL.

// Categories that describe code health rather than security exposure. These
// are reported, and they are not scored.
//
// Real-scan finding 2026-07: a private cockpit with zero critical and zero
// high findings scored 53 and read as MODERATE RISK. 47 of its 78 mediums
// were cyclomatic-complexity opinions from the AI Codegen Bloat family, which
// is already exempt from OWASP mapping precisely because it is maintainability
// rather than security. A security score dragged to its floor by opinions
// about function shape is measuring the wrong thing, and it tells someone who
// has fixed every real defect that they are still at moderate risk.
//
// The honest split: security findings move the score, maintainability findings
// are advisory. isAdvisoryFinding is exported so the UI can show the count
// separately instead of silently dropping it.
